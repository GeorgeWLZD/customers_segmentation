# Customer Segmentation Project README

## Business Case
A global company has experienced a **decline in sales** over the past six months. Despite an **established customer base** and a diverse catalog, revenue has been steadily declining. The marketing team has tried various strategies, such as discounts and general promotions, but these tactics have not been able to stop the decline in sales.

Given this situation, management believes that they should start implementing strategies based on the purchasing **profile of each customer**.

Thus, they have identified an opportunity to apply a **customer segmentation** strategy based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis with the ultimate goal of improving the company's performance.

## Clustering Results

Base on the clustering analysis I identified 4 customer segments, which are the following.

### Newcomers (segment 1, size: 949 | 23%)
These are customers with low spending and low purchase frequency. However, their high recency indicates they have made a purchase relatively recently. 
Likely new customers or those testing the brand.

### Casuals (segment 2, size: 848 | 21%)
This group has moderate values across all dimensions. They spend occasionally, purchase somewhat frequently, and have a moderate recency. 
They are engaged at a basic level but have untapped potential.

### At-Risk (segment 3, size: 2000 | 49%)
These customers have low spending and frequency, but their moderate recency indicates they are still somewhat engaged. 
They are on the verge of becoming inactive and require attention to prevent churn.

### Big Spenders (segment 4, size: 270 | 7%)
These are the most valuable customers. They spend a lot, purchase frequently, but their low recency indicates they havenâ€™t made a recent purchase. 
They are highly loyal but at risk of disengaging if not re-engaged.

Here we can **visualize the profiles** of each segment:
